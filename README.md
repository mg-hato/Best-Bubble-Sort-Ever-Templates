# Best Bubble-Sort Ever (Templates)

This repository is a journey and mostly a personal reminder of going into templates.
It explores the idea of a typical bubble sort algorithm, going from single type and less-than comparison towards templates-inspired implementation.

It has the following chapters:

### Starting with bubble sort

Initial setup

### First template

Adding first template and removing the restriction of `int` only

### But why does it have to be ascending order

Adding another template for ordering

### Why the operator()

Short discussion why the `operator()` was used to implement comparators in toy examples
